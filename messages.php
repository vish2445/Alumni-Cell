        <b>Dear Alma Mater,</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        It is a blissful opportunity for me to come back as a Director of NIT Delhi where my journey as a Director
        began. Apart from many important academic affairs, one of my visions and topmost priority is to know our alma
        mater more closely. Thus, to implement this thought; the institute have setup a new cell, i.e. the ‘Office of
        Alumni, International Affairs, and Public Relations’ which is committed to build the liaisoning between the
        Institute and our alma mater so as to identify the several ways through which the Institute can continue to
        offer the various opportunities for enhanced learning and personal development. I hope this cell will definitely
        prove to be a useful resource and networked hub for your career advancement and future progress. Also, this cell
        will act as a platform for you to come back to your old institute where you can meet with fellow-alumni to
        strengthen the social network. During the past years, I have been in constant touch with many of our esteemed
        Alumni and feel so proud to see them serving at such higher positions in various government organizations,
        corporate/ private sector, business firms along with various social and civic societies. I am very proud of our
        alumni graduates and aspire to have an illustrious list of such students and alumni who have not only strived to
        be the best in the world but to be the best for the world.

        On your part, I hope that you will definitely like to get engaged with NIT Delhi and be part of its activities to keep the values of the Institute alive. I feel that our Alma matters can actively contribute to achieve the visions of the institute by participating in the grooming process for the next generation of NIT Delhi graduates. The Institute is keen to be associated with all of you. I request each one of you to come forward to make NIT Delhi, the most inspirational Institute of India. The unforgettable memories that were marked by all of you at this place will always remain in our hearts… Thus I would like to beckon you for a special bond that will not only be a symbiotic relationship between us rather it will connect us in a very emotional link that will never break for life time…
<br>
<br>
        The bond will last forever with thy Alma Mater...
        <br>
        <br>
        All my best wishes, blessings, and regards...
<br>
